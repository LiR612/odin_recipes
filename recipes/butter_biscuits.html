    <h1>Butter Biscuits</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Our favourite recipe for butter biscuits has become the “go-to” biscuit recipe for our readers, 
        many of whom have added their own twist - including powdered ginger, choc chips and peanut butter. 
        It’s also a great recipe for budding bakers who can be in charge of rolling the dough into little balls 
        and then pressing with the tines of a fork (I loved doing that as a kid!). Because they make 30 biscuits 
        there'll be plenty on hand for afterschool snacks or just timeout with a cup of tea.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Biscuits</h4>
        <li>125g butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup caster sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp pure icing sugar, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Using an electric mixer, beat butter, sugar and vanilla in a small bowl until pale and creamy. Add egg and mix until well combined. Sift flour and baking powder over butter mixture. Add milk and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Using 2 teaspoons of dough at a time, roll dough into balls. Place on baking trays lined with baking paper. Using a lightly-floured fork, flatten biscuits slightly (allow room for spreading).</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, swapping trays over in oven after 10 minutes, or until light golden. Allow to cool on trays for 5 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Dust with icing sugar. Serve.</li>
